/*
ECMAScript : is scripting language specification on which JavaScript is based. Every new year the rules may change. 

JavaScript : is a scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript also includes additional features 
that are not part of the ECMAScript specification, which is crutial for webdevelopmet.

V8 : is a an open sourse javascript engine developed by the chromium project fir compiling javaScript code into native machine
code before execution

What is Node.js : Some smart people took out the V8 engine and added some backend features(Like reading the files and other file handling)
and create HTTP servers(to create a new runtime to compete with BE languages like java)for backend(where we were using the Java before). Java was
never meant to be run in the backend eventually become very popular and is a popular choice of runtime on the backend.

What is Bun : Other than the fact that JS is a single threaded, Node.js is slow(multiple reasons for it) Some smart people said they wanted
to rewrite the JS runtime for backend and introduced BUN which is significantly faster runtime. It's written in Zig.
